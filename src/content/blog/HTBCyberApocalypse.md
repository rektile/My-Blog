# Introduction
In March 2023, I joined the massive Cyber Apocalypse CTF event organized by Hack the Box. With its massive prize pool of â‚¬35,000+ and thousands of participants, this five-day challenge promised an unforgettable experience. As part of a team of enthusiastic individuals, I ventured into the world of cybersecurity, ready to showcase my skills and tackle the diverse challenges that awaited us.

# My Experience
Among the wide range of categories, I found myself particularly invested in the web challenges. During the event, one challenge in the web category truly captivated my attention. It required combining multiple vulnerabilities, including XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), file upload bypass, and content security policy bypass, to retrieve the flag. This complex task pushed me to think outside the box, requiring a combination of technical expertise and creative thinking. I was thrilled to discover that my efforts paid off as I successfully cracked the challenge and obtained the flag.

# Conclusion
Participating in the Cyber Apocalypse CTF event allowed me to showcase my skills and learn from fellow participants. After the Cyber Apocalypse CTF event, I spent time reading write-ups from other participants. I learned a lot from their solutions. I highly recommend joining these events or participating in challenges on platforms like Hack the Box. They offer valuable learning opportunities and a chance to test your skills in a practical and engaging way.
