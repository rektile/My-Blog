# Introducion
Malware poses a significant threat to computer users, causing security breaches and data theft. To address this issue, I created a project called "Malware Watcher." In this blog, we will explore why I made this program, how it works, and its benefits for analyzing malware.

# Why Did I Make It?
I developed Malware Watcher after a friend experienced a malware infection and asked for my help. While trying to fix the issue, I realized there was a lack of tools specifically designed to analyze and track changes made by malware on a computer system. This inspired me to create Malware Watcher as a tool to assist in understanding malware behavior.

# How Does It Work?
Malware Watcher is a lightweight program that checks a computer system before and after running malware. It focuses on monitoring key areas, such as registry keys, files, DNS cache, and the Windows Scheduler.

When you launch Malware Watcher, it takes a snapshot of the system's current state, creating a baseline for comparison. As you run malware, the program actively monitors these areas, detecting any changes made by the malicious software.

By comparing the post-malware execution state with the baseline, Malware Watcher shows you the specific changes that occurred. It highlights newly created or modified registry keys, altered files and directories, changes in the DNS cache, and suspicious additions to the Windows Scheduler.

# Conclusion
Malware Watcher is a valuable tool for analyzing malware. It helps you understand how malware affects a computer system by monitoring and reporting changes in critical areas. While it does not replace antivirus scanners, Malware Watcher complements existing security measures by providing insights that aid in malware analysis.
